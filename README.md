# README(.)md Generator

## Description
I created this app as an introductionary project to node.js. Im also really enjoying JavaScript overall and I wanted to also practice creating with the language. I decided on a README generator because I constantly have to create one for assignments and I wanted to stream line that process and save some time. My biggest obstacle with this was turning the license options and turning them into the corresponding badge and text. Creating a new variable and cycling it through a if/else statement solved that issue for me. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)
If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
